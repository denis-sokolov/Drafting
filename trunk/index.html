					<p>Warning!</p>
					<p>
						You are using Internet Explorer.
						The browser is unbelievably unfriendly to both
							users and developers.
						It&rsquo;s behaviour is unexpected and unpredictable.
						Thus I give no guarantee, how the application will
							work under this browser.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the sake of yourself and the Internet, please
							move to a better browser.
						I advice choosing
							<a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>,
						but there is
							<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox">Firefox</a>
							or
							<a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a>,

						Hello, fellow judge!
					</p>
					<p>
						The application is supposed to help you call the
							standart draft.
					</p>
					<p>
						The idea is that all you have to do is read the
							text on the screen and watch the players.
						However, sometimes you will encounter
							<em class="template">emphasized</em> text,
							which you should change according to your draft
							situation.
					</p>
					<p>
						The draft is divided into actions/screens, where
							the program will wait for your action of
							pressing a button, which you should <strong>not</strong>
							announce. ^_^
					</p>
					<p>
						Since the button is always focused, the application
							is controlled with the <strong>space</strong> button.
					</p>
					<p>
						More information about the program will be found
							<a href="#endStep">at the end</a> of the
							program.
					</p>
					<button>Understood. Let&rsquo;s go!</button>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="warning">
						Notice: the program is in beta status.
					</p>
					<p>
						This means that it might make mistakes and you
							should be ready to continue the draft
							manually at any time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please report all bugs and feature requests
							(including text changing proposals) to
							<span class="email">drafting@sokolov.cc</span>.
